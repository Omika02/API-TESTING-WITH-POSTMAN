DOMAIN: AUTOMATION TESTING

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

#  Task Description

The task was to **create and execute automated test cases for a REST API using Postman and Newman CLI**.

The main objectives were:

* âœ… Test REST API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
* âœ… Write assertions to validate **status codes, response body, headers, and response time**.
* âœ… Export the Postman collection as a `.json` file.
* âœ… Run the collection from the command line using **Newman**.
* âœ… Generate reports (CLI/HTML) to track which test cases passed or failed.

This ensures the API behaves correctly and consistently under different scenarios.

# Tools Used

 ðŸ”¹ 1. **Postman**

* A popular API testing tool with a graphical interface.
* Used to **create API requests, group them in collections, and add automated tests** with JavaScript-based assertions.
* Makes API testing easy for developers and QA engineers.

 ðŸ”¹ 2. **Newman CLI**

* A command-line tool that runs Postman collections without needing the Postman app.
* Useful for **automation, CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab, Azure DevOps, etc.)**.
* Generates test execution reports (CLI, HTML, JSON).

 ðŸ”¹ 3. **Reqres API** (for demo)

* A free **mock REST API** ([https://reqres.in](https://reqres.in)).
* Provides dummy endpoints (`GET /users`, `POST /users`, etc.) for practice and testing.
  

# ðŸ“Œ Real-Life Usage

API testing with Postman & Newman is widely used in the **software development industry**:

1. **Quality Assurance (QA) Teams**

   * Validate APIs before release.
   * Ensure different systems (frontend â†” backend â†” database) work properly.

2. **Developers**

   * Use Postman to test APIs during development.
   * Automate regression testing to avoid breaking existing features.

3. **DevOps / CI-CD Pipelines**

   * Newman runs collections in **build pipelines** (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps).
   * Ensures APIs are tested automatically after each code deployment.

4. **Production Monitoring**

   * API test collections can run on schedules to ensure APIs are up and running.


 Example in Real Projects:

* **E-commerce website** â†’ APIs for user login, product listing, cart, payment. Postman tests ensure login returns 200, payment returns success, etc.
* **Banking system** â†’ APIs for transactions, balance checks, loan approvals. Automated testing ensures correctness before going live.
* **Healthcare apps** â†’ Secure API testing for patient records & reports.
